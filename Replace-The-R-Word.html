        <p>The R-word is the word 'retard(ed)'. Why does it hurt? The R-word hurts because it is <b>exclusive</b>. It's <b>offensive</b>. It's <b>derogatory</b>. <b>Replace the R-Word</b> asks people to discover new ways to express themselves as a way to be more mindful of how your words can hurt those with disabilities without you even knowing it. The change starts with you, and you are well on your way! Look up new words today to better describe the way you are feeling using respectful, people-first language! </p>
        <h3 class = "sectionTitle">Words can hurt<br>(but they don't have to).</h3> <!--insert code here or on JS to make pictures rotate, update pictures-->
